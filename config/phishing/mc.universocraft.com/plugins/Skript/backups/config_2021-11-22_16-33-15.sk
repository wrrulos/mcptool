# == Introduction ==
# This file contains Skript's general options. To write scripts, create a new .sk file in the scripts folder or edit any existing one.
#
# Script files prefixed with a hyphen (-) will not be loaded, e.g. renaming 'plant with hoe.sk' to '-plant with hoe.sk' will disable the whole file.
# This can e.g. be used to temporarily disable scripts and is also used for Skript's example scripts.
# You can also use the command '/skript enable/disable <script>' to enable/disable a script which will automatically rename it.
#
# === !!! PLEASE NOTE !!! ===
# This file, all scripts and other files ending in .sk are NOT .yml/YAML files, but very similar!
# Please remember the following when editing files:
# - To indent sections you can use spaces like in YAML, but tabs are also allowed. Just remember to stick to the one or the other for a section/trigger.
# - '#' starts a comment like in YAML. If you don't want it to start a comment simply double it: '##' (You also have to double these in "quoted text")
# - If you use special characters (§, äöü, éèàôç, ñ, etc.) you have to encode the file in UTF-8.
#



# ==== General Options ====

language: english
# Which language to use. Currently english and german are included in the download, but custom languages can be created as well.
# Please note that not everything can be translated yet, i.e. parts of Skript will still be english if you use another language.
# If you want to translate Skript to your language please read the readme.txt located in the /lang/ folder in the jar
# (open the jar as zip or rename it to Skript.zip to access it)


check for new version: false
# Whether Skript should check for whether a new version of Skript is available when the server starts.
# If this is set to true Skript will announce a new version to all players with the "skript.admin" permission.
# If set to false you can still check for a new version with '/skript update check'.
# Please note that Skript will not detect beta releases even if you are running one as they are not necessarily stable.

update check interval: 12 hours
# If 'check for new version' is enabled, this sets how often to check for a new update.
# A first check will always be made when the server starts, after that checks will be made in intervals set by this option.
# Set this to 0 to disable repeated checks, in which case only one check will be made when the server starts.
# Please note that this option is currently the only means of making Skript check for an update more than once,
# as '/skript update check' does only display the results of the last check if a check has been made before.

automatically download new version: false
# Whether Skript should automatically download & install the newest version if one is available.
# I suggest to disable this feature if your server restarts automatically as you likely won't be informed
# of any incompatibilities of your scripts and the newest version of Skript.
# If you disable this you can still use '/skript update download' to make Skript download the newest version.
# If you're concerned about changes use '/skript update changes' for a full list of changes since your current version.


enable effect commands: false
effect command token: !
# If 'enable effect commands' is set to true, chat messages starting with the 'effect command token' will be interpreted as effects and executed.
# The token can be longer than a single character, but it should not start with '/' as that starts a command.
# A player needs the permission "skript.effectcommands" to use such commands,
# which does not default to OPs since these commands can do severe damage to the world or crash the server (see below).
# Some example commands which can be used if this setting is enabled:
#	!heal player - heals the player (doesn't do anything if used from the console)
#	!repair tool - repairs the currently held item
#	!broadcast "<red>Please read the rules!" - if you want to get rid of the quotes you have to define a custom command
#	!set time to 6:00 - sets the time in the current world
# The command can also be abused, so only give the permission to trusted players, like owners & co-owners:
#	!spawn 20 ender dragons - will destroy a large part of the world in a short time if no protection is present
#	!create explosion of force 10000 - likely crashes the server or at least hangs it up for a long time
#	!ban all players - as the effect implies

allow ops to use effect commands: false
# Whether server operators which do not have the permission "skript.effectcommands" should have access to effect commands.
# This setting is mainly useful for servers that do not run any permissions plugin.


use player UUIDs in variable names: false
# Whether to use a player's UUID instead of their name in variables, e.g. {home.%player%} will look like
# {home.e5240337-a4a2-39dd-8ed9-e5ce729a8522} instead of {home.njol}.
# Please note that if this setting is changed old variables WILL NOT be renamed automatically.


date format: default
# The date format to be used when dates should be displayed.
# This can be 'default' to use Java's default date format for the system's language.
# The format is that of Java's SimpleDateFormat as defined here: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html
# some examples:
#  d/M/yyyy h:mm a => 15/7/2012 8:53 PM
#  dd.MM.yyyy, HH:mm => 16.03.2013, 09:33


verbosity: normal
# Determines how much info is logged.
# Allowed values: low, normal, high, very high, debug
# The highest you should go is very high, which prints quite a lot of useful information,
# including how much time each trigger takes to execute.
# Only use debug if you're programming an add-on for Skript, but even then you might usually not need it.


plugin priority: high
# Allowed values: lowest, low, normal, high, highest
# Change this if you encounter problems with other plugins, e.g.:
# - cancelled events: The event is cancelled by another plugin, but Skript handles the event nonetheless => increase priority
#                    (e.g. WorldGuard cancels events if a player doesn't have permission for the given region,
#                     and you made some 'place' triggers which should not bypass WorldGuard's protection)
# - effects '(un)cancel event': Another plugin should/should not process the event, but does/does not => decrease priority
# - effect 'drop': Another plugin doesn't process added drops => decrease priority
# - effects 'remove ... from drops'/'clear drops': Drops added by other plugins are not removed => increase priority
#                                                  Skript removes drops it shouldn't => decrease priority or specify which item types to remove


log player commands: true
# Whether Skript should log the usage of custom commands.
# They will be logged as [INFORMATION] in this format: '<player>: /<command> <arguments>'


number accuracy: 2
# How many digits should be displayed after the dot at maximum when displaying numbers.
# Zeroes will never be displayed at all, so this setting only applies to numbers that actually have a decimal part with one or more non-zero digits.
# Money bypasses this setting and is displayed as configured in your economy plugin if you have one.


maximum target block distance: 100
# How far to search for a player's targeted block in blocks/meters.
# Lower values improve performance, but might reduce the usability of your scripts.
# This value is limited by the server (e.g. by 'view-distance' in the server.properties), but is guaranteed to work up to 100 meters.


case sensitive: false
# Whether Skript's functions should be case sensitive or not.
# This e.g. applies to the effect 'replace' and the conditions 'contains' and 'is/is not'.
# Variable names are case-insensitive irrespective of this setting.


disable variable conflict warnings: false
# Disables warnings of potential variable name conflicts if set to true.
# I recommend to not touch this option, but if you do so you should at least set it back to false
# whenever you create new scripts with new variables.



# ==== Variables ====

databases:
	# Databases to store variables in. These can either be used as a simple one-server-storage
	# where variables are written constantly but only read at server start,
	# or as a connection between multiple servers by monitoring the database(s) for changes.
	#
	# You can define as many databases as you want, just make sure to choose a distinct name for each one, and don't forget to set all options correctly.
	#
	# To be able to use a database you'll need to download the plugin 'SQLibrary' from http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/sqlibrary/files/
	# and install it in your server's plugin directory like other plugins.
	#
	# Please note that '/skript reload' will not reload this section, i.e. you'll have to restart Skript for changes to take effect.
	
	# Each database definition must be in a separate section. You can choose any name for the sections, as long as it's not already used.
	database 1:
		# an example database to describe all possible options.
		
		type: disabled
		# The type of this database. Allowed values are 'CSV', 'SQLite', 'MySQL' and 'disabled'.
		# CSV uses a text file to store the variables, while SQLite and MySQL use databases, and 'disabled' makes Skript ignore the database as if it wasn't defined at all.
		
		pattern: .*
		# Defines which variables to save in this database.
		# This pattern uses Regex syntax, e.g. use 'db_.*' (without the quotes) to store all variables prefixed with 'db_' in this database,
		# or use '.*' (the default value) to store all variables here (recommended for the last database in this list, as otherwise some variables might not be saved).
		# Please note that variables are only stored in one database, and databases are checked from top to bottom,
		# e.g. if a variable matches the topmost database's pattern it will be saved there and nowhere else.
		# BTW: Patterns are checked in a separate thread, i.e. your server likely won't run slower when using complicated patterns.
		
		monitor changes: false
		monitor interval: 20 seconds
		# If 'monitor changes' is set to true, variables will repeatedly be checked for updates in the database (in intervals set in 'monitor interval').
		# ! Please note that you should set 'pattern', 'monitor changes' and 'monitor interval' to the same values on all servers that access the same database!
		
		# == MySQL configuration ==
		host: localhost# Where the database server is located at, e.g. 'example.com', 'localhost', or '192.168.1.100'
		port: 3306# 3306 is MySQL's default port, i.e. you likely won't need to change this value
		user: root
		password: pass
		database: skript# The database to use. Skript will automatically create a table 'variables21' in this database if it doesn't exist
		# (If the table exists but is defined differently that how Skript expects it to be you'll get errors and no variables will be saved and/or loaded)
		
		# == SQLite/CSV configuration ==
		file: ./plugins/Skript/variables.db
		# Where to save the variables to. For a CSV file, the file extension '.csv' is recommended, but not required, but SQLite database files must end in '.db' (SQLibrary forces this).
		# The file path can either be absolute (e.g. 'C:\whatever\...' [Windows] or '/usr/whatever/...' [Unix]), or relative to the server directory (e.g. './plugins/Skript/...').
		
		backup interval: 2 hours
		# Creates a backup of the file every so often. This can be useful if you ever want to revert variables to an older state.
		# Variables are saved constantly no matter what is set here, thus a server crash will never make you loose any variables.
		# Set this to 0 to disable this feature.
		
		
	MySQL example:
		# A MySQL database example, with options unrelated to MySQL removed.
		
		type: disabled# change to line below to enable this database
		# type: MySQL
		
		pattern: synced_.*# this pattern will save all variables that start with 'synced_' in this MySQL database.
		
		host: localhost
		port: 3306
		user: root
		password: pass
		database: skript
		
		monitor changes: true
		monitor interval: 20 seconds
		
	SQLite example:
		# An SQLite database example.
		
		type: disabled# change to line below to enable this database
		# type: SQLite
		
		pattern: db_.*# this pattern will save all variables that start with 'db_' in this SQLite database.
		
		file: ./plugins/Skript/variables.db
		# SQLite databases must end in '.db'
		
		backup interval: 0# 0 = don't create backups
		monitor changes: false
		monitor interval: 20 seconds
		
	default:
		# The default "database" is a simple text file, with each variable on a separate line and the variable's name, type, and value separated by commas.
		# This is the last database in this list to catch all variables that have not been saved anywhere else.
		# You can modify this database freely, but make sure to know what you're doing if you don't want to loose any variables.
		
		type: CSV
		
		pattern: .*
		
		file: ./plugins/Skript/variables.csv
		
		backup interval: 2 hours
		
		# PS: If you don't want some variables to be saved in any database (e.g. variables that contain an %entity% which usually despawn when the server is shut down)
		# you can modify the last database's pattern to not match all variables, e.g. use '(?!x_).*' to match all variables that don't start with 'x_'.
		# Be very cautious when doing this however as unsaved variables cannot be recovered after the server has been stopped.
		# I recommend to use a single character to denote unsaved variables (similar to local variables' '_'), e.g. '-', in which case the last database's pattern should be '(?!-).*'.
		
		
		
		# ==== Settings that should not be changed ====
		
version: 2.2-SNAPSHOT
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS VALUE MANUALLY!
# This saves for which version of Skript this configuration was written for.
# If it does not match the version of the .jar file then the config will be updated automatically.
