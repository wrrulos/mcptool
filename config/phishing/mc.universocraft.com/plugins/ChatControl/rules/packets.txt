# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file manages special rules that can overlap messages by other plugins,
# or even the server itself. Requires ProtocolLib.
# 
# This accepts *ONLY* operators below:
#
# Valid operators:
# match <regex> (A valid regular expression to match the checked message.)
# then replace <message> (A word to replace the part of the message that is matched.)
# then rewrite <message> (A message to replace the whole checked message.)
# then rewritein <world> <message> (A message to replace the whole checked message in specified world. 
#                                   You can use this together with 'rewrite' as a fallback on other worlds, or
#                                   add multiple operators in one rule for multiple worlds.)
# dont verbose (Rule won't print to the console. Ignores 'Verbose' option in settings.yml.)
# then deny (Hides the message - cancels the packet.)
#
# For valid variables (e.g. {world}) check the header in the rules.txt file!
#
# Supports color codes with & and unicode characters when saved in UTF-8 encoding.
