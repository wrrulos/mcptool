# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#         Welcome to the main configuration of ChatControl
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# [General support and updates]
# http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chatcontrol.271
# 
# [Default configuration with comments]
# https://github.com/kangarko/ChatControl/blob/master/settings.yml
#
# [Tips]
# - Color codes are supported with the '&' character, see
#   http://minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Formatting_codes for usage
#
# - To not display a message, set it to 'none'.
#
# - Unicode /special characters/ only work when files are saved in 
#   UTF-8 encoding. Tested on Notepad++, WordPad on Windows is broken.
#
# - Most of the messages (warnings, etc) are found in the localization. 
#   To customize it, make a new file in "localization/messages_LOCALE.yml" 
#   (Replace LOCALE with the actuall locale name, by default 'en'). It
#   will be filled with all default values and kept with sync on updates.
